               <h2>Brief Description</h2>
               
               <p id="testP">For as long as I could remeber my sister had talked about going to Alaska. She would talk about the amazing temperatures, the endless amount of moutains, and the constant rain drizzle that never goes away. However, for many reasons we never got to go. That is until one of my closest friends moved up to Juneau in early 2022. We saw this as a opportunity and jumped on it. Joined by my older brother, my sister and I went on an amazing journey to the Alaskan frontier in June of 2022.</p>

               <h2>Whale Watching</h2>
               
               <p class="funParagraph">After getting some rest from the flight the first official event we did for the trip was whale Watching. This was pretty interesting experience. We were on the water surrounded by moutains it really made you feel small.</p>

               <h2>Dog Sledding</h2>
               
               <p>This was probably my favorite thing we did. The dogs were all very cute and super social. They came up to you for pets and treats.</p>

               <p>We went to a old gold mine and explored some parts of it. We had a tour guide who had a very think Alaskan accent and was pretty funny. They also demostrated a very old drill they used for mining.</p>
